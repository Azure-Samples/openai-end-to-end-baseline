/*
  This template creates a role assignment for a managed identity to access indexes in AI Search.

  To ensure that each deployment has a unique role assignment ID, you can use the guid() function with a seed value that is based in part on the
  managed identity's principal ID. However, because Azure Resource Manager requires each resource's name to be available at the beginning of the deployment,
  you can't use this approach in the same Bicep file that defines the managed identity. This sample uses a Bicep module to work around this issue.
